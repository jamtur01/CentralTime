          ## What's New in 2.0.0
          
          ### üé® **Complete UI Redesign**
          - Modern SwiftUI interface with clean, single-line city displays
          - Dynamic menu bar text showing current city emoji, code, and time
          - Proper status bar implementation using NSStatusItem + NSPopover
          
          ### üåç **Enhanced City Management**
          - Cities now sorted by timezone offset (west to east)
          - Improved city selection interface with search functionality
          - Fixed duplicate city issues - each city appears only once
          - Better timezone data management using Swift's built-in TimeZone APIs
          
          ### ‚öôÔ∏è **Better Settings Experience**
          - Fixed settings window sizing and positioning
          - Proper window management - Cancel/Save buttons no longer close the app
          - Settings window can be reopened without conflicts
          
          ### üîß **Technical Improvements**
          - Replaced hardcoded timezone data with dynamic TimeZoneManager
          - Better error handling and window lifecycle management
          - Improved code organization and maintainability
